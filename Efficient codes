1. [Two sorted arrays merge them in constant time](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/efficiently-merging-two-sorted-arrays-with-o1-extra-space/)

2.[Two sorted arrays find their median in O(min(log(n),log(m)))](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-two-sorted-arrays-of-different-sizes/)

Two sorted arrays of (either both of even size or both of odd size) find the sum of middle two elements after merging:
